      <p>Hello, I'm Tyler and I'm a developer. </p>

      <p>Programming, and development in general, has always been my passion. From my first robotics class in the seventh grade to now ten years later, I have pushed my understanding of the technolgical world and loved every minute of it.</p>

      <p>My abilities are diverse; I use popular web frameworks including AngularJS, Django, and Rails. These frameworks require that I be proficient in languages like HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Ruby, Python, and SQL.</p>

      <p>When I develop for others, I make it my priority and my mission to keep the process as involved as possible. I believe in a transparent experience where the client is fully aware and informed at all times. By following these simple principle, the end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
